# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

* Added a mandelbrot inspired from https://github.com/lucas-santoni/mandelbrot-c-sdl2 Each time the snake will eat food, a new mandelbot will be drawn.

* Added a score list file.

* Profiled and fixed bugs. The mendelbot uses a lot of CPU, beauty won't come for free.

* Game can be paused hitting the spacebar
* Game can be speeded up with +
* Game can be slowed down with -

* Added a blocker that would kill the snake, if hit.
* Added a "GAME OVER!" message in the canvas.
